# Latex Plays

## Class

A LaTeX document doesn't stand alone - commonly the document is based on a versatile template. Such a fundamental template is called a class. It provides customizable features, usually built for a certain purpose. There are classes for books, for journal articles, for letters, for presentations, for posters and many more.

## Preamble

The first part of the document is called the preamble of the document. This is where we choose the class, specify properties and in general, make document-wide definitions.

`\begin{document}` marks the end of the preamble.

## Environment

The `\begin` and `\end` command pair is called an environment.
